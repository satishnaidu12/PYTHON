if shell=True then your cmd is a string (as your os command)
if shell=False then your cmd is a list.

Note: shell=False then don't work on your os environment variables.

ex: cmd="ls -ltr" ==>Shell=True
    shell=False ==> cmd="ls -ltr".split() or ["ls","-ltr"]

shell=True ==> always true on Windows.
